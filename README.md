üëÅÔ∏è „Ä¢ Explanations of Features and options


@hazard: Here put your final file name like who is not going to be obvious


@hazard: This is a option to "KILL" all discord clients opened 
and to restart them with the blackcap injection 
(so i recommand "yes")


@hazard: This is a option to "KILL" all process which could analyze the properties of blackcap, 
such as the task manager, the terminal or even analysis tools (so i recommand "yes")


@hazard: This is a option to ping when someone run BlackCap you can specify "everyone" or "here"


@hazard: This option replaces each of the crypto addresses copied by the victim with yours, 
it will not realize that it is not the same and during a payment the cryptomoney will be sent 
to your address

//Yeah, that OP i know


@hazard: If you chose 'yes' to the previous option you will have to fill in this with 
YOUR crypto wallet addresses 
(You can also put mine)üëå


@hazard: This option allows you to display an error message when someone launches your blackcap 
for the moment it is a predefined message but later it will be customizable


@hazard: This option will make a copy of the .exe in the windows startup of your victims and 
blackcap will therefore launch at each start

(if you have activated the address crypto replacer I advise you to activate this one)


@hazard: This option will close automatically the window that will launch blackcap 
(also works if you let the final file in .py so i recommand 'yes')


@hazard: This option will obfuscate the source code "BUT THIS OBFUSCATION WAS DETECTED"
I recommand to chose 'no'


@hazard: This option will create an .exe if you put 'no' the final file will be an .py


@hazard: If you chose 'yes' in the previous option this option will add an icon to your .exe
